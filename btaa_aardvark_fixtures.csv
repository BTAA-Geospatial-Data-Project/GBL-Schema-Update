11,Tenure (owner or renter) by race of householder (Boundaries): United States,County,"This layer shows tenure (owner or renter) by race of householder.This is shown by tract, county, and state boundaries.This service is updated annually to contain the most currently released American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data, and contains estimates and margins of error. There are also additional calculated attributes related to this topic, which can be mapped or used within analysis. This layer is symbolized by the overall homeownership rate. To see the full list of attributes available in this service, go to the ""Data"" tab, and choose ""Fields"" at the top right.Current Vintage: 2014-2018ACS Table(s): B25003, B25003B, B25003C, B25003D, B25003E, B25003F, B25003G, B25003H, B25003IData downloaded from:Census Bureau\'s API for American Community SurveyDate of API call: December 19, 2019National Figures:data.census.govThe United States Census Bureau\'s American Community Survey (ACS):About the SurveyGeography & ACSTechnical DocumentationNews & UpdatesThis ready-to-use layer can be used within ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, its configurable apps, dashboards, Story Maps, custom apps, and mobile apps. Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data.Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December. The layer always contains the latest available ACS 5-year estimates. It is updated annually within days of the Census Bureau\'s release schedule.Click hereto learn more about ACS data releases.Boundaries come from theUS Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintageas specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500kTIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles. The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters).The States layer contains 52 records - all US states, Washington D.C., and Puerto RicoCensus tracts with no population that occur in areas of water, such as oceans, are removed from this data service (Census Tracts beginning with 99).Percentages and derived counts, and associated margins of error, are calculated values (that can be identified by the ""_calc_"" stub in the field name), and abide by the specificationsdefined by the American Community Survey.Field alias names were created based on theTable Shellsfile available from theAmerican Community Survey Summary File Documentation page.Negative values (e.g., -555555...) have been set to null. These negative values exist in the raw API data to indicate the following situations:The margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.The median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution, or in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.The estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.The data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.NOTE: any calculated percentages or counts that contain estimates that have null margins of error yield null margins of error for the calculated fields.",English,Esri,Esri,,Datasets,Polygon data,Society,,ACS|demographics|people|states|counties|tracts|Tenure|Race|Ethnicity|Housing|Demographics|Policy|AmericanCommunitySurvey|Census|CensusBureau|homeownership|currentyear|housing|Homeownership,2020,2018-10-22,2020-2020,United States,"-179.1474,17.8848,179.7785,71.3526",99-1100,,,,Public,Shapefile,,,,019f5e3f77da4c89bf6d00b376389a0c_1,http://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/019f5e3f77da4c89bf6d00b376389a0c_1,99-1100,Aardvark,FALSE,FALSE,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,2020-10-06,,,,,,https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/019f5e3f77da4c89bf6d00b376389a0c_1.zip,https://services.arcgis.com/P3ePLMYs2RVChkJx/arcgis/rest/services/ACS_Housing_Tenure_by_Race_Boundaries/FeatureServer/1,,,,,,,http://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/019f5e3f77da4c89bf6d00b376389a0c_1,,,,,,,,,

3,1:100k Digital Raster Graphic - Collars Removed: Minnesota,,"A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of an U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The map is scanned at a minimum resolution of 250 dots per inch.  DRG's are created by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners.  The raster image is georeferenced and fit to the UTM projection.  Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and artifacts.  The average data set size is about 6 megabytes in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) with PackBits compression. DRG's can be easily combined with other digital cartographic products such as digital elevation models (DEM) and digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ).  DRG's are stored as rectified TIFF files in geoTIFF format. GeoTIFF is a relatively new TIFF image storage format that incorporates georeferencing information in the header. This allows software, such as ArcView, ARC/INFO, or EPPL7 to reference the image without an additional header or world file.  Within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Core GIS data set the DRG's have been processed to be in compliance with departmental data standards (UTM Extended Zone 15, NAD83 datum) and the map collar information has been removed to facilitate the display of the DRG's in a seamless fashion.

18,"1-Meter Shaded Relief Multibeam Bathymetry Image (Color): Elkhorn Slough, California, 2005",,"This layer is a 10-color shaded relief GeoTIFF that contains high-resolution bathymetric data collected from the Elkhorn Slough region of Monterey Bay, California. The survey for Elkhorn Slough was conducted 8/12/2005 - 8/15/2005. Elkhorn Slough, one of the largest remaining coastal wetlands in California, has been directly subjected to tidal scour since the opening of Moss Landing Harbor in 1946. This erosion endangers the habitat of several rare and endangered species and disrupts the wetland ecosystem as a whole. In 2003, the Seafloor Mapping Lab of California State University, Monterey Bay created the most detailed bathymetry model of the Slough to date using a combination of multi-beam sonar, single-beam sonar and aerial photography. This layer was created as part of the California Seafloor Mapping Project.This project was conducted to determine changes in the pattern of erosion and deposition in Elkhorn Slough since surveys conducted in 1993, 2001 and 2003. Marine data offered here represent the efforts of a comprehensive state waters mapping program for California launched by the California State Coastal Conservancy, Ocean Protection Council, Department of Fish and Game, and the NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program. The ultimate goal is the creation of a high-resolution 1:24,000 scale geologic and habitat base map series covering all of California's 14,500 km2 state waters out to the 3 mile limit, and support of the state's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (MLPA) goal to create a statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This statewide project requires, involves and leverages expertise from industry, resource management agencies and academia. The tiered mapping campaign involves the use of state-of-the-art sonar, LIDAR (aerial laser) and video seafloor mapping technologies; computer aided classification and visualization; expert geologic and habitat interpretations codified into strip maps spanning California's land/sea boundary; and the creation of an online, publicly accessible data repository for the dissemination of all mapping products.\n",English,Seafloor Mapping Lab,Seafloor Mapping Lab,Stanford,,Raster data,Imagery and Base Maps|Elevation|Inland Waters,Continental margins|Multibeam mapping,,2005,1905-06-27,2005-2005,Elkhorn Slough (Calif.)|Monterey Bay (Calif.),"-121.7948738,36.8085911,-121.7389503,36.8606925",,,,"These data are licensed by Stanford Libraries and are available to Stanford University affiliates only.

43,2015 New York City Subway Complexes and Ridership,,"The subway complexes layer was created to represent ridership data for the NYC subway system (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA). This layer is a subset of the subway stations layer (nyu_2451_34503) that has been combined with MTA statistics on ridership; it was originally created in August 2012 and has been updated annually. Ridership data is not available for each individual subway station, as many stations are linked via common entrances and passageways where transfers are free, and because ridership data is not collected for the Staten Island Railway stations. This layer was created by choosing an individual station from nyu_2451_34503 to represent the entire complex, and modifying the station name and train fields appropriately. It should be used for mapping ridership data or for analysis that requires this data, and not for specifying actual station locations or measuring distances. There are 421 complexes, and the field station_ct indicates how many stations are part of a complex. Annual, average weekday, and average weekend ridership is provided for 2007 to 2014. The unique ID is complex_id, which was created by alphabetizing the complexes by borough and station name and assigning a sequential number to a borough prefix. This layer does not include the new 34th St - 11 Av station on the 7 line; it will be updated in summer 2016 once ridership data becomes available.

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The map is scanned at a minimum resolution of 250 dots per inch.  DRG's are created by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners.  The raster image is georeferenced and fit to the UTM projection.  Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and artifacts.  The average data set size is about 6 megabytes in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) with PackBits compression. DRG's can be easily combined with other digital cartographic products such as digital elevation models (DEM) and digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ).  DRG's are stored as rectified TIFF files in geoTIFF format. GeoTIFF is a relatively new TIFF image storage format that incorporates georeferencing information in the header. This allows software, such as ArcView, ARC/INFO, or EPPL7 to reference the image without an additional header or world file.  Within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Core GIS data set the DRG's have been processed to be in compliance with departmental data standards (UTM Extended Zone 15, NAD83 datum) and the map collar information has been removed to facilitate the display of the DRG's in a seamless fashion.
